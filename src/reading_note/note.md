### [A Theoretical Understanding of Chain-of-Thought: Coherent Reasoning and Error-Aware Demonstratio](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16540)

Proposed a new algorithm for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. The algorithm is rather naive: just adding a new row in parameter holding past prompts. 

This article also have lengthy statistical analysis on the new prompting algorithms. Specifically, it calculated the best (that is, least) lost for coherent. (I am not sure if this is indeed the best.) The proof is naive. 

[An interesting assumption](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18869) of mathematical models for prompting LLMs is cited in the paper.
